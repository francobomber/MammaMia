The cat sat on the mat, watching the bird outside the window
It was a sunny day, and the birds were singing their morning songs.The cat stretched lazily, then yawned, showing its small pink tongue
Suddenly, a large, colorful butterfly landed on the windowsill, its wings a vibrant mix of orange and black
The cat's ears perked up, and its tail began to twitch with excitement
It crouched down low, ready to pounce, but just as it gathered its muscles for a jump, the butterfly flew away, disappearing into the blue sky
